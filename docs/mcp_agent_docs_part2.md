# OrganiX MCP Documentation (Part 2)

## Composio Integration

OrganiX features deep integration with Composio, a platform that extends MCP with additional capabilities:

### Synchronization

The MCP Manager automatically synchronizes with Composio to:

1. Register local tools with the Composio platform
2. Import tools from Composio to the local environment
3. Maintain consistent tool definitions across environments

```python
# Sync tools with Composio
await mcp.refresh_composio_tools()
```

### Composio CLI

The integration includes support for the Composio CLI, allowing command-line operations:

```bash
# Install Composio CLI
composio_client.install_cli()

# Configure CLI with credentials
composio_client.configure_cli()

# Run CLI commands
result = composio_client.run_cli_command("list tools")
```

## Multi-Agent Coordination

OrganiX implements a sophisticated multi-agent system that leverages MCP for coordination:

### Agent Types

The system includes several specialized agents:

1. **Research Specialist**: Focused on information retrieval and synthesis
2. **Code Specialist**: Specialized in generating and analyzing code
3. **Blockchain Specialist**: Expert in blockchain technologies, especially Solana
4. **MCP Specialist**: Focused on tool selection and integration
5. **AGI Specialist**: Handles complex reasoning and multi-domain problems

### Routing and Coordination

Queries are automatically routed to the most appropriate agent based on intent detection:

```python
# Route a query to the best agent
result = await coordinator.route_to_best_agent(query)
```

For complex queries, multiple agents can collaborate:

```python
# Process with multiple agents
result = await coordinator.multi_agent_collaboration(
    query,
    agent_ids=["researcher", "coder", "blockchain"]
)
```

### Intent Detection

The system uses intent analysis to determine the most appropriate agent:

```python
# Analyze intent
intent = ChatIntent(query)
primary_intent = intent.primary_intent  # e.g., "blockchain", "web_search", etc.
```

### Context Awareness

All agent interactions are context-aware, incorporating relevant memory:

```python
# Process with context awareness
result = await coordinator.process_with_context_awareness(query)
```

## Advanced Capabilities

### Zero-Knowledge Integration

OrganiX integrates zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving operations:

```python
# Create a proof of knowledge without revealing the data
proof = await coordinator.create_zero_knowledge_proof("knowledge", sensitive_data)

# Verify a proof
verification = await coordinator.verify_zero_knowledge_proof(proof)
```

### Blockchain Capabilities

The system includes comprehensive blockchain capabilities:

```python
# Get data for a Solana address
blockchain_data = await coordinator.get_blockchain_data(address)

# Get HTML for Phantom wallet connection
connect_button = coordinator.get_phantom_connect_html("My dApp")
```

Key blockchain features:
- Solana account information
- Token balance retrieval
- NFT ownership verification
- Transaction history analysis
- Phantom wallet integration

## Extending the System

### Adding New Tools

You can easily extend OrganiX with new tools:

```python
# Register a custom tool
mcp.register_tool(
    "my_custom_tool",
    "Description of what my tool does",
    my_tool_function
)
```

### Creating Custom Agents

Custom agents can be added to the system:

```python
# Create a custom agent
coordinator.register_agent(
    "my_agent",
    ChatPersona(
        name="My Specialized Agent",
        description="Description of my agent's capabilities",
        system_prompt="Detailed instructions for the agent..."
    )
)
```

### Building Tool Chains

Complex workflows can be created by chaining tools together:

```python
async def process_data_workflow(data):
    # Step 1: Analyze data
    analysis = await mcp.process_with_tools(f"Analyze this data: {data}")
    
    # Step 2: Generate recommendations
    recommendations = await mcp.process_with_tools(
        f"Based on this analysis: {analysis}, what recommendations can you provide?"
    )
    
    # Step 3: Create a summary report
    report = await mcp.process_with_tools(
        f"Create a report summarizing the analysis: {analysis} "
        f"and recommendations: {recommendations}"
    )
    
    return report
```

## Best Practices

### Effective Tool Design

1. **Clear Purpose**: Each tool should have a single, well-defined purpose
2. **Descriptive Names**: Tool names should clearly indicate their function
3. **Comprehensive Descriptions**: Include detailed descriptions for accurate tool selection
4. **Input Validation**: Validate inputs before processing
5. **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages and graceful failure
6. **Asynchronous Design**: Use async functions for non-blocking operations
7. **Statelessness**: Design tools to be stateless when possible

### Security Considerations

1. **Input Sanitization**: Always sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
2. **Permission Management**: Implement proper permission controls for sensitive operations
3. **Credential Protection**: Never expose API keys or credentials in tool outputs
4. **Audit Logging**: Log tool usage for security auditing
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for external API calls

### Performance Optimization

1. **Caching**: Cache results for frequently used tools
2. **Parallel Execution**: Run independent tools in parallel
3. **Resource Management**: Monitor and limit resource usage for intensive operations
4. **Cold Start Reduction**: Pre-warm tools that require initialization
5. **Timeout Handling**: Implement timeouts for operations that might hang

## MCP Best Practices for AGI

When implementing MCP for advanced agents with AGI capabilities:

1. **Clear Context**: Provide clear context about available tools
2. **Tool Discovery**: Allow the model to discover and experiment with available tools
3. **Reasoning Paths**: Enable step-by-step reasoning in complex tool usage
4. **Adaptive Selection**: Use context and intent to select the most appropriate tools
5. **Composed Workflows**: Build complex solutions by combining multiple tools
6. **Self-correction**: Allow the model to recognize and correct tool usage errors
7. **Human Feedback**: Incorporate feedback to improve tool selection and usage

Remember that tool selection is as important as tool implementation. The right tool for the right task makes all the difference in agent performance.
