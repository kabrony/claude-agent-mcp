    """Identifies and tracks user intent in conversations"""
    def __init__(self, text=None):
        self.text = text
        self.confidence = 0.0
        self.detected_intents = {}
        self.primary_intent = None
        
        # Process intent if text is provided
        if text:
            self.analyze_intent(text)
    
    def analyze_intent(self, text):
        """Analyze text to detect intent"""
        self.text = text
        
        # Intent pattern matching
        intent_patterns = {
            "question": r"\b(?:who|what|when|where|why|how|is|are|can|could|would|should|do|does|did)\b.+\?",
            "command": r"\b(?:please|can you|would you|i want|i need|make|create|show|find|get|search|help)\b",
            "chat": r"\b(?:hi|hello|hey|howdy|greetings|good morning|good afternoon|good evening)\b",
            "feedback": r"\b(?:thanks|thank you|good|great|excellent|awesome|terrible|bad|poor|not good|not helpful)\b",
            "blockchain": r"\b(?:solana|phantom|wallet|blockchain|crypto|nft|token|transaction|eth|bitcoin|btc)\b",
            "web_search": r"\b(?:search|find|look up|google|information about|latest|news|current)\b",
            "agent_action": r"\b(?:run|execute|perform|start|activate)\b"
        }
        
        # Pattern matching logic and confidence calculation
        # ...
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Agent Routing

```python
# Initialize the multi-agent coordinator
coordinator = MultiAgentCoordinator()

# Process a query with automatic routing to the best agent
result = await coordinator.route_to_best_agent(
    "How does zero-knowledge technology work in blockchain applications?"
)

print(f"Query handled by: {result['agent_name']}")
print(f"Response: {result['response']}")
```

### Explicit Agent Selection

```python
# Process with a specific agent
result = await coordinator.process_with_agent(
    "coder",
    "Write a Python function to connect to the Solana blockchain"
)

print(f"Response from Coder agent: {result['response']}")
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

```python
# Process with multiple agents collaborating
result = await coordinator.multi_agent_collaboration(
    "Create a secure system that uses Solana for authentication and implements zero-knowledge proofs",
    agent_ids=["coder", "blockchain", "mcp"]
)

print(f"Synthesized by: {result['agent_name']}")
print(f"Contributors: {result['contributing_agents']}")
print(f"Response: {result['response']}")
```

### Context-Aware Processing

```python
# Process with context awareness
result = await coordinator.process_with_context_awareness(
    "Improve the solution you provided earlier"
)

print(f"Context-aware response: {result['response']}")
```

## Integration with MCP

The multi-agent system integrates seamlessly with the Model Context Protocol:

```python
# MCP Specialist handling tool integration
result = await coordinator.process_with_agent(
    "mcp",
    "I need to extract data from a webpage about Solana staking"
)

# This automatically leverages appropriate tools through MCP
print(f"Tool-enhanced response: {result['response']}")
```

## Advanced Features

### Agent Memory Integration

Each agent interaction is stored in the memory system with appropriate metadata:

```python
# Memory is automatically stored for each agent interaction
memory_id = memory_system.add_memory(
    "episodic",
    query,
    {
        "type": "agent_query",
        "agent_id": agent_id,
        "agent_name": persona.name
    },
    importance=3
)
```

### Intelligent Query Routing

The system dynamically routes queries based on intent and context:

```python
async def route_to_best_agent(self, query):
    """Route a query to the most appropriate agent"""
    # Analyze intent
    intent = ChatIntent(query)
    log.info(f"Detected intent: {intent.primary_intent} (confidence: {intent.confidence:.2f})")
    
    # Route based on intent
    if intent.primary_intent == "blockchain" and "blockchain" in self.agents:
        return await self.process_with_agent("blockchain", query)
    elif intent.primary_intent == "web_search" and "researcher" in self.agents:
        return await self.process_with_agent("researcher", query)
    # ... other routing logic
```

### Cross-Domain Reasoning

The AGI agent enables sophisticated reasoning across domain boundaries:

```python
# Process with the AGI agent for complex cross-domain reasoning
result = await coordinator.process_with_agent(
    "agi",
    "What are the technical, economic, and ethical implications of implementing zero-knowledge proofs for digital identity verification on Solana?"
)
```

## System Analysis and Visualization

The system provides tools for analyzing and visualizing the multi-agent architecture:

```python
# Generate explanation of the multi-agent system
explanation = await coordinator.explain_multi_agent_system()
print(explanation["explanation"])
```

## Extending the System

### Creating Custom Agents

You can easily create and register new specialized agents:

```python
# Create a custom agent persona
security_persona = ChatPersona(
    name="Security Specialist",
    description="Expert in cybersecurity and secure system design",
    system_prompt="""You are a Security Specialist agent within OrganiX.
Your primary role is to provide expertise on cybersecurity, secure system design,
threat modeling, and security best practices.
When discussing security topics, prioritize defense-in-depth, principle of least privilege,
and practical, actionable guidance."""
)

# Register the new agent
coordinator.register_agent("security", security_persona)

# Use the new agent
result = await coordinator.process_with_agent(
    "security",
    "How can I securely store private keys for a blockchain application?"
)
```

### Customizing Intent Detection

You can extend the intent detection system with new patterns:

```python
# Add custom intent patterns
custom_intents = {
    "security": r"\b(?:security|hack|vulnerability|exploit|secure|protect|encrypt)\b",
    "finance": r"\b(?:money|finance|investment|stock|crypto|price|cost|value)\b"
}

# Register with the intent analyzer
for intent, pattern in custom_intents.items():
    intent_analyzer.add_intent_pattern(intent, pattern)
```

## Best Practices

### Effective Query Formulation

To get the best results from the multi-agent system:

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly state your query or task
2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant background information
3. **Indicate Domains**: Mention specific domains if you want certain expertise
4. **Request Collaboration**: For complex problems, explicitly request multi-agent collaboration

### System Performance Optimization

For optimal performance:

1. **Memory Management**: Periodically run memory maintenance to prune old memories
2. **Context Limitation**: Provide relevant context but avoid overwhelming the system
3. **Incremental Complexity**: Break down very complex tasks into smaller steps
4. **Agent Selection**: For specialized tasks, directly select the appropriate agent

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Incorrect Agent Routing**
   - **Problem**: Query routed to inappropriate agent
   - **Solution**: Be more explicit about intent or manually specify agent

2. **Context Confusion**
   - **Problem**: Agent loses track of conversation context
   - **Solution**: Provide explicit context or reference previous interactions

3. **Multi-Agent Synthesis Failures**
   - **Problem**: Inconsistent or contradictory multi-agent responses
   - **Solution**: Break down complex problems or manually review individual agent responses

## Conclusion

The OrganiX Multi-Agent System represents a significant advancement in AI agent architecture, enabling more sophisticated reasoning, domain-specific expertise, and collaborative problem-solving than traditional single-agent approaches. By leveraging specialized agents, intent-based routing, and advanced coordination mechanisms, the system provides higher quality responses, better domain expertise, and more capable handling of complex, multi-domain problems.
