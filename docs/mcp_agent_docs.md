# OrganiX Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a powerful framework that enables AI models to access external tools and capabilities through a standardized interface. OrganiX leverages MCP to create a flexible, extensible agent system that can interact with various tools, services, and data sources.

This document provides comprehensive documentation on how MCP is integrated into OrganiX, how to leverage its capabilities, and how to extend it with new tools and functionality.

## Core Components

### MCP Manager

The `MCPManager` class is the heart of the MCP integration. It:

- Registers tools with unique identifiers and descriptions
- Tracks tool usage and statistics
- Handles tool execution and error management
- Synchronizes with Composio for external tool integration
- Provides analytics on tool performance and usage patterns
