# OrganiX Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a powerful framework that enables AI models to access external tools and capabilities through a standardized interface. OrganiX leverages MCP to create a flexible, extensible agent system that can interact with various tools, services, and data sources.

This document provides comprehensive documentation on how MCP is integrated into OrganiX, how to leverage its capabilities, and how to extend it with new tools and functionality.

## Core Components

### MCP Manager

The `MCPManager` class is the heart of the MCP integration. It:

- Registers tools with unique identifiers and descriptions
- Tracks tool usage and statistics
- Handles tool execution and error management
- Synchronizes with Composio for external tool integration
- Provides analytics on tool performance and usage patterns

### Tool Registration

Tools in OrganiX MCP follow a standard format:

- **Name**: Unique identifier for the tool
- **Description**: Human-readable description of the tool's functionality
- **Function**: The actual implementation that executes when the tool is called
- **Metadata**: Optional additional information about the tool

Each tool can have optional input validation, error handling, and usage tracking.

## Built-in Tools

OrganiX comes with several built-in tools:

### System Tools
- `list_files` - List files in a directory
- `execute_command` - Execute system commands (with security restrictions)

### Web Research Tools
- `web_search` - Search the web for information
- `extract_url` - Extract content from a specific URL

### Memory Tools
- `retrieve_memory` - Retrieve relevant memories
- `retrieve_memory_by_timeframe` - Get memories from a specific time period
- `summarize_memories` - Generate summaries of recent memories
